# KockaSite
Back when I was learning web programming I was testing stuff on http://kocka.dilfa.com and this is the code previously in the backend. Passwords were stored in a `kocka.ini` file that was outside of the directory so I'm not concerned about stealing my keys. Well except the Google app key. But I deleted that app already anyways. Big and unnecessary files have been removed from the site.

Personal information has been stripped from the site, hopefully.
